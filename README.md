# dashmap

Blazingly fast concurrent map in Rust.

DashMap is an implementation of a concurrent associative array/hashmap in Rust.

DashMap tries to implement an easy to use API similar to `std::collections::HashMap`
with some slight changes to handle concurrency.

DashMap tries to be very simple to use and to be a direct replacement for `RwLock<HashMap<K, V>>`.
To accomplish these all methods take `&self` instead modifying methods taking `&mut self`.
This allows you to put a DashMap in an `Arc<T>` and share it between threads while being able to modify it.

DashMap puts great effort into performance and aims to be as fast as possible.
